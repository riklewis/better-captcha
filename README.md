# Better Captcha
This is a Wordpress plugin that stops bad bots from attacking your forms using [hCaptcha](https://bettersecurity.co/hcaptcha/) or simple maths questions.

[hCaptcha](https://bettersecurity.co/hcaptcha/) is a drop-in replacement for Google's reCAPTCHA, but with the added benefit of getting paid for challenges completed.

> Private. Secure. Faster. And we pay you to use it.

Please note, you will need a free [hCaptcha](https://bettersecurity.co/hcaptcha/) account for this plugin to work in hCaptcha mode, but the simple maths questions mode works locally with no account required.
