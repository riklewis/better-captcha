# Better Captcha
This is a Wordpress plugin that stops bad bots from attacking your forms using [hCaptcha](https://bettersecurity.com/hcaptcha/).

[hCaptcha](https://bettersecurity.com/hcaptcha/) is a drop-in replacement for Google's reCAPTCHA, but with the added benefit of getting paid for challenges completed.

> Private. Secure. Faster. And we pay you to use it.

Please note, you will need a free [hCaptcha](https://bettersecurity.com/hcaptcha/) account for this plugin to work.
