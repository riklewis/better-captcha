Stop bad bots from attacking your forms using hCaptcha

== Description ==

This plugin stops bad bots from attacking your forms using hCaptcha (https://bettersecurity.co/hcaptcha/).

hCaptcha is a drop-in replacement for Google's reCAPTCHA, but with the added benefit of getting paid for challenges completed.

"Private. Secure. Faster. And we pay you to use it."

Please note, you will need a free hCaptcha account for this plugin to work.
